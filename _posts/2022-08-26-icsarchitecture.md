Recently I've become very interested in Operational Technology (OT) security, more speficially Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Supervisory Control And Data Acquistion (SCADA) security. Systems such as these require a unique perspective when it comes to securing them, particularly because they are so different to the standard kind of systems we secure in IT.

The scope of this post is to define a basic understanding of what an ICS is, and what the security architecture for one of these systems might look like. Please note that I am still learning myself, so my apologies for any mistakes and feedback is more than welcome.
