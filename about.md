Hi there! I'm Billy Gigurtsis, a passionate cybersecurity professional with a strong focus on cloud security engineering. With expertise spanning endpoint, infrastructure, architecture, and threat modeling, I bring a well-rounded approach to securing digital assets. I thrive in fast-paced environments, where I've led high-performing teams and built robust security programs from the ground up.

My love for cloud security, especially within the AWS ecosystem, drives me to architect and implement secure solutions using the latest technologies and best practices. I'm a firm believer in shifting security left and collaborating closely with development teams to create secure CI/CD pipelines and promote infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform.

Continuous learning is a core part of who I am. I hold multiple certifications, including AWS Certified Security, CompTIA Security+, GIAC GFACT, and GIAC GSEC, which showcase my commitment to staying current with industry standards and best practices. I'm also deeply curious about various aspects of cybersecurity, such as public cloud security research, OT security, functional programming, Arduino, and low-level computing.

Through this blog, I aim to share my insights, experiences, and passion for cybersecurity with the broader community. If you'd like to connect, discuss potential collaborations, or just geek out about all things security, feel free to reach out. I'm always eager to engage with like-minded professionals and explore new opportunities in this exciting field!
