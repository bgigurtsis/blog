Hey! I'm Billy, a cybersecurity professional who's found a love for cloud security engineering. The cloud, especially AWS, is where I get to combine my technical skills with my love for building secure and scalable systems.

I've had the privilege of leading security programs from scratch, which has taught me that great security is as much about people and processes as it is about technology. 

My curiosity drives me to constantly explore new areas, from OT security to Arduino and low-level computing. I find the rapidly evolving world of cybersecurity fascinating, and I'm always eager to learn more. This drive has led me to earn several certifications including AWS Security and a couple of certs from SANS!

When I'm not immersed in cloud security, you might find me experimenting with functional programming or choreographing performances. I started this blog to share what I've learned along the way and hopefully contribute something valuable to the security community.

I'm always up for connecting, so please do drop me a line if you'd like to say hi - https://www.linkedin.com/in/bgigurtsis/
